                Pushyamitra Shunga is one of the most legendary warrior and Emperor of Bharat. 
                He killed the last Ruler of Maurya Dynasty and saved Bharat from the Greek invasion 
                who are using the no war strategy of last Maurayan Emperor to capture india 
                by capturing Budhhist Monastries and paying bribes to the budhhist monks . 
                Our history has forgotten him , our marxist historians presented him as the 
                killer of budhhists and destroyer of Budhhism and they also presented him that 
                he destroyed 80,000 budhhist stupas .
