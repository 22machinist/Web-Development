        He killed the last Ruler of Maurya Dynasty and saved Bharat from the Greek invasion 
        who are using the no war strategy of last Maurayan Emperor to capture india 
        by capturing Budhhist Monastries and paying bribes to the budhhist monks .

        killer of budhhists and destroyer of Budhhism and they also presented him that 
        he destroyed 80,000 budhhist stupas .
